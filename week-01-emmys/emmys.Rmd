## Read data
The data are drawn from the "Tidy Tuesday" project: [2021 Week 39: Emmy Awards and Nominees](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-09-21/readme.md) (credit: [Emmys website](https://www.emmys.com/awards/nominations/award-search)/[Susie Lu](https://www.susielu.com/data-viz/emmy-2017)).  They have been lightly cleaned.

```{r read-data, message = FALSE}
nominees <- readRDS("week-01-emmys/data/nominees_clean.rds")
```

The rest of this document will be filled in during the live coding session on Thursday.
