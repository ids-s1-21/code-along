## Read data

The data are drawn from the “Tidy Tuesday” project: [2021 Week 39: Emmy
Awards and
Nominees](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-09-21/readme.md)
(credit: [Emmys
website](https://www.emmys.com/awards/nominations/award-search)/[Susie

cleaned.

``` r
nominees <- readRDS("data/nominees_clean.rds")
```

The rest of this document will be filled in during the live coding
session on Thursday.
